<h1> David Python blog lesson </h1>
In this blog, I will be sharing my journey of learning machine learning. Being a tech enthusiast, the concept of AI and machine learning has always intrigued me. Hence, I decided to venture into this exciting domain.<br />
<br />
Before I delve into my experiences, let me give a brief introduction about Machine Learning. It is a subset of artificial intelligence which provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This is achieved by developing computer programs that can access data in order to learn for themselves.<br />
<br />
As a beginner, I started my journey by learning Python, a popular programming language for machine learning. It's a versatile, high-level programming language that is widely used for a variety of fields, and is known for its simplicity.<br />
<br />
The first thing I did was to familiarize myself with Python's syntax, variables, loops, etc. Then I moved on to more complex topics like classes and functions. This foundation was crucial before moving onto machine learning algorithms.<br />
<br />
Next, I dived into the world of libraries and frameworks. Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib became my new friends. They provide tools and techniques to make the Python programming more manageable and efficient.<br />
<br />
The next step was to explore machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. These libraries provide pre-written code to implement various machine learning algorithms, which is a great help for beginners like me.<br />
<br />
The journey of learning machine learning can be overwhelming due to its vastness. But the key is to take one step at a time. I took my time to understand each concept thoroughly before moving on to the next. <br />
<br />
Now, I am at a stage where I am implementing basic machine learning algorithms and it is truly fascinating to see machines learning and improving. The more I learn, the more I realize the potential and impact of machine learning in the world of technology.<br />
<br />
In the upcoming blogs, I will share more about my experiences and lessons learned, and hopefully, it will help others who are on the same path as me. <br />
<br />
Learning is a continuous journey and I am excited to see where this journey takes me. Stay tuned for more updates on my adventure into machine learning.</body>
