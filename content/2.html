<h1> The valley of Loire, a hidden gem for family traveling </h1>
The Loire Valley, known as 'the Garden of France', is an enchanting place filled with spectacular landscapes, magnificent chateaus, and world-class vineyards. We recently traveled through this stunning region as a part of our world schooling journey and were absolutely taken aback by its beauty and the plethora of learning opportunities it offers for children.<br />
<br />
Our journey began in the city of Tours, a perfect base for exploring the Loire Valley. The city itself is bursting with historical charm, with its cobbled streets and half-timbered houses. We visited the Saint-Gatien Cathedral, an architectural marvel that left both us and the kids in awe. The cathedral's stained glass windows, some dating back to the 13th century, were a perfect way to introduce our children to medieval art.<br />
<br />
One of the highlights of our trip was visiting the iconic Château de Chenonceau. The kids were thrilled to explore the castle that seemed straight out of a fairy tale. They learnt about French history, Renaissance architecture, and even had a chance to enjoy a boat ride under the castle's arches.<br />
<br />
We also visited the Clos Lucé, the final residence of Leonardo da Vinci, which now serves as a museum dedicated to his life and work. The kids were fascinated by the interactive exhibits showcasing Da Vinci's inventions. This visit ended up being a fantastic practical lesson in art, science, and history.<br />
<br />
Another must-visit is the Château de Villandry, famous for its stunning gardens. Our kids loved running through the maze, and we spent a delightful afternoon picnicking amidst the beautifully manicured gardens.<br />
<br />
The Loire Valley is not just about castles and history; it also offers some fantastic outdoor adventures. We rented bikes and embarked on a picturesque ride along the Loire River, which was a hit with our active kids. We also visited the Beauval Zoo, home to a wide variety of animals including pandas, which were the kids’ favorite.<br />
<br />
The Loire Valley also provided us with ample opportunities to introduce our children to French cuisine. We visited local markets, where the kids learnt about different cheeses, fruits, and pastries. We even took a family cooking class, where we learnt to make some classic French dishes.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the Loire Valley is a hidden gem for family traveling. Its combination of history, culture, outdoor activities, and culinary delights make it an ideal destination for world schooling. We're already looking forward to our next visit!<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for more of our family travels as we continue to explore and learn from the world.</body>
